# stock-analysis-app
stock analysis using streamlit,yfinance,prep api you can see stock chart ,stock fundamentals, news, you can even screen for stocks, and most importantly can predict future prices using machine learning through facebook's prophet module

make sure to download all the python modules before using.




make sure to change the path of all the files accorrding to your system's reference


i have used firebase to authenticate my app  if you want to use the app you can just use a random email and password (eg: mail-random_email_68@email.com or passowrd-more than 8 char ) or you can use your own fire base setup and can have you own database
i am the free version of the api which allow only 200 request per day.You can even attach your own api key by signning up in prep_api




lastly ----> to run the app open the terminal and run 'streamlit run main.py' make sure to run the main.py
